# React project, Redux, Express, MongoDB, Material-UI, Jest

Project theme: Farm Inventory with 3 animal types.  The farmer/user has an overview of his livestock and can update to their name and output.  They can introduce new animals to the farm and they can pair two animals of the same type to create a new animal.

# Redux

The search function parameters and results are stored centrally and are shared among two screens.  Updated animal state and paired animal state are also stored this way.

# Express server side API with MongoDB

The MongoDB authentication keys were stored in a .env file which has been removed for the purpose of this upload.
